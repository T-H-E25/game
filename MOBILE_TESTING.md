# Mobile Testing Guide for SH!TSHOT

## Pre-Deployment Mobile Checklist

### Touch Controls
- [ ] Crosshair follows touch movement smoothly
- [ ] Tap to shoot works reliably
- [ ] Mobile "FIRE" button works
- [ ] Touch events don't conflict with browser gestures
- [ ] Supports multi-touch (crosshair + UI interaction)

### Game Performance
- [ ] 60fps gameplay on mobile devices
- [ ] Smooth target movement animations
- [ ] No lag in touch response
- [ ] Memory usage stays reasonable during gameplay
- [ ] Battery consumption is optimized

### Mobile UI/UX
- [ ] All buttons are large enough for touch (44px minimum)
- [ ] Text is readable on small screens
- [ ] Game overlay doesn't interfere with gameplay
- [ ] Modal dialogs work properly on mobile
- [ ] Orientation lock works (if implemented)

### Responsive Design
- [ ] Looks good on phones (320px - 480px width)
- [ ] Looks good on tablets (768px - 1024px width)
- [ ] Safe areas respected (iPhone notch, etc.)
- [ ] Content doesn't overflow viewport
- [ ] Proper scaling on high-DPI displays

### Mobile Features
- [ ] Haptic feedback works (if implemented)
- [ ] Can be added to home screen (PWA)
- [ ] Works offline for core gameplay
- [ ] Fast loading on mobile networks
- [ ] Handles network interruptions gracefully

## Device Testing Priorities

### High Priority Devices
1. **iPhone (iOS Safari)**
   - iPhone 12/13/14 (most common)
   - Test both portrait and landscape
   
2. **Android Chrome**
   - Samsung Galaxy S series
   - Google Pixel devices
   
3. **iPad/Android Tablets**
   - Larger touch targets
   - Different aspect ratios

### Testing Tools

#### Browser DevTools
```bash
# Chrome DevTools device emulation
# F12 â†’ Toggle device toolbar
# Test: iPhone 12 Pro, Galaxy S20, iPad
```

#### Real Device Testing
- Use ngrok or similar for local testing on devices
- Test with actual touch (not mouse simulation)
- Test on different network conditions

## Mobile-Specific Game Features

### Touch Optimizations
```css
/* Prevent text selection on game elements */
user-select: none;
-webkit-user-select: none;

/* Prevent touch callouts on iOS */
-webkit-touch-callout: none;

/* Prevent zoom on double-tap */
touch-action: manipulation;
```

### Performance Optimizations
- **Target size optimization** - Larger targets on smaller screens
- **Animation throttling** - Reduce animations on low-end devices
- **Asset optimization** - Smaller images for mobile
- **Memory management** - Clean up game objects properly

### Mobile Game Controls
1. **Crosshair Movement**
   - Touch and drag to move crosshair
   - Visual feedback for touch position
   
2. **Shooting**
   - Tap anywhere to shoot at crosshair position
   - Dedicated "FIRE" button for better control
   
3. **UI Interaction**
   - Large touch targets for menus
   - Swipe gestures for navigation (if implemented)

## Common Mobile Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Touch lag or inaccuracy
**Solutions:**
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth updates
- Minimize DOM manipulations during touch events
- Use CSS transforms instead of changing position properties

### Issue: Viewport problems
**Solutions:**
- Proper viewport meta tag
- CSS viewport units (vh, vw) instead of percentages
- Account for mobile browser UI (address bar)

### Issue: Performance degradation
**Solutions:**
- Reduce number of animated elements
- Use CSS transforms for better GPU acceleration
- Implement object pooling for targets
- Throttle expensive operations

### Issue: Network connectivity
**Solutions:**
- Implement retry logic for Supabase calls
- Show connection status to user
- Cache game assets for offline play

## Mobile Testing Checklist After Deployment

### Functional Tests
1. Load game on mobile device
2. Complete full gameplay session
3. Test member signup/login flow
4. Verify database connectivity
5. Test different game modes (2D/3D)

### Performance Tests
1. Monitor frame rate during gameplay
2. Check memory usage over time
3. Test on slower devices/networks
4. Verify smooth animations

### Usability Tests
1. Can users easily aim and shoot?
2. Are UI elements large enough?
3. Is text readable without zooming?
4. Do users understand mobile controls?

The game is now fully optimized for mobile deployment!
